# deliverapl
This repository contains materials for a talk which was first delivered at FunctionalConf'19 as "Delivering your APLs" (tagged as "fnconf19"), and updated in for MeetUps in Toronto and New York City.

In 2023, the sub-folder WorkerBees was added, containing code to manage multiple APL interpreters within one process, under the control of a C# programme.

The complete list of folders is now:

* DLL_PythonLib: Python calling APL as a DLL
* DotNetAssy: .NET Assembly (called from C# under Linux)
* Interactive: Interactive APL Session - Windows

* PortableUI: Cross-Platform GUI (Desktop AND Web)

* PynAPL: Integrated with Python (using PynAPL under Windows)
* Serverless: AWS Lambda
* Shebang: #! Scripting - Linux

* WebService: Web Service in Docker Container (Powershell under Windows & curl under Linux)
* WorkerBees: Multiple interpreters in one process managed by C#
